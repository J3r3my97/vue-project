# Final Project Proposal

## Your Thoughts

This project is to develop a social media platform called _Your Thoughts_, which allows users to add thoughts to a list and have other users vote his or her thoughts by pressing a _agree_ button or _disagree_ button. What’s more, we are going to categorize the thoughts in the future for the final project.

## Stacks used

- VueJs (front-end framework)
- Firebase (back-end database)
- Bootstrap (Layout)
